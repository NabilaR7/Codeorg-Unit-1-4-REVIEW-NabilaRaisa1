      <div class= "wave" id = "Lesson1">
    <b>Lesson 1</b>
      <p>Question: What will the value of score be at the end of the program?  Note: <- is used to represent a left facing arrow
        <hr>
  Answer: The score is 4 </p>
      </div>
      <div class= "wave" id = "Lesson2">
      <b>Lesson 2</b>
      <p>Question: Explain in your own words the process of creating and updating a variable. How does the Counter Pattern with Event work?
        <hr>
        Answer:In order to enable a callback to the variable later on in the program, creating and updating variables come first. Variables are crucial because they enable program modifications. The Counter Pattern Event interrupts the original sequential program and modifies an event by acting as an event program.</p>
      </div>

      <div class= "wave" id = "Lesson3">
      <b>Lesson 3</b>
      <p>Question: The program below is run. Which of the following COULD NOT possibly be the output from that program?
        <hr>
        Answer: 10,5,10,5 </p>
      </div>

      <div class= "wave" id = "Lesson4">
      <b>Lesson 4</b>
      <p>Question: What are the similarities and differences between the binary and decimal systems?
        <hr>
        Answer: Both binary and decimal uses the numbers 0 and 1 to give something a value. The difference is that the binary system uses 0 and 1 to represent numbers and is used for computer programing, while the decimal uses numbers 0-9 to represent its numbers.</p>
      </div>

      <div class= "wave" id = "Lesson5">
      <b>Lesson 5</b>
      <p>Question: Can a computer evaluate an expression to something between true and false? Can you write an expression to deal with a "maybe" answer?
        <hr>
        Answer:Yes the computer can evaluate an expression to something between true and false. A computer can't deal with a maybe answer. This will give an expression to deal with a "maybe" answer for humans because somebody might have a different opinion.</p>
      </div>

      <div class= "wave" id = "Lesson6">
      <b>Lesson 6</b>
      <p>Question: When creating an if-else-if statement you should always make your first condition the most specific. Write a short paragraph responding to the questions below. What does it mean to put the most specific case first? Why is it important to put the most specific case first? What types of errors does it help avoid?
        <hr>
        Answer: It means to put the one that matters the most first, before the others. Placing the most specific case first in programming and computational contexts is crucial to prevent logical errors, such as overlooked conditions due to prior general case matches.</p>
      </div>

      <div class= "wave" id = "Lesson7">
      <b>Lesson 7</b>
      <p>Question: The program below asks a user to type in a number and then will output a message. What number will a user need to input for the message "COLD" to be displayed?
        <hr>
        Answer: 5</p>
      </div>

      <div class= "wave" id = "Lesson8">
      <b>Lesson 8</b>
      <p><b>TICKET GENRATOR APP</b></p>
      </div>

      <div class= "wave" id = "Lesson9">
      <b>Lesson 9</b>
      <p>Question: In your own words describe the benefits of creating functions in your code?
        <hr>
        Answer: It's organized and easier to call when you need it later in the coding, and you can call it whenever you want.</p>
      </div>

      <b>Lesson 10</b>
