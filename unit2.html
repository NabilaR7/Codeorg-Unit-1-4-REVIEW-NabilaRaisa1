      <b>Lesson 4</b>
      <p>What are the benefits of building redundancy into a network? What are the potential issues with building redundancy?
        <hr>
        Answer: More redundancy equals more reliability. It also helps with distributed site management. The idea is that if one device fails, another can automatically take over. By adding a little bit of complexity, we reduce the probability that a failure will take the network down.
