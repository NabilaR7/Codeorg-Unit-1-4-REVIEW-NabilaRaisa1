    <b>Unit 1</b>
    <hr>
    <p>In this unit, we learned the basics of HTML including common tags like img and how to properly structure web pages. We covered topics like using non-copyrighted images, providing alternate text, binary/bytes/bits (with the 'flippity doo' mnemonic), overflow, sampling, analog vs digital data, and favicons. The key takeaways were understanding HTML as the structure for web pages, using tags properly to display content like images, and supplementing visual content with textual descriptions. We gained hands-on experience building basic pages through replit lessons. Overall, this gave us an introduction to fundamental web development concepts that we will continue to build on going forward.</p>

    <b>Unit 2</b>
    <hr>
    <p>In this unit, we learned the basics of CSS and how to style webpages to make them visually appealing and user-friendly. We covered working with style sheets to customize color, layout, fonts, etc. Debugging code was a key skill we developed. Additionally, we learned how the internet functions on the back-end. Key topics included understanding computer networks, data transmission concepts like paths, bandwidth, and protocols. We researched core ideas like IP addresses and Internet protocols. Through hands-on projects, we gained first-hand experience leveraging CSS to enhance web page design. We now have an introductory yet nuanced grasp of front-end development with HTML/CSS as well as fundamental internet architecture enabling communication between computers and networks. Moving forward, we can build on this core knowledge of styling web content and technical processes powering internet technology.

    <b>Unit 3 </b>
    <hr>
    <p>In the start we used code.org to check out peopleâ€™s apps and how they work/what their purpose was. We learned everything there was to know about how an app is made and what exactly they mean. Such as: Output and user Interface which the user using the app sees, and Input is what they input to make the output happen. We learned how to make the buttons work when we click them using the onEvent function that lets us change whatever we want. And then at the end we were tasked to create an app of our own with a partner using pair programming.
</p>

  <div class="wave" id="u4">
    <b>Unit 4</b>
    <hr>
    <p>In this unit we learn about JavaScript and the importance of variables. We can store only one thing in the variable but have multiple values to it. We learned about Boolean expressions, strings and numbers and how to use them using logical operators and in conditional statements. We also learned that using comments is very helpful because when things get hectic it can help us stay organized. We used pseudo code which helped us in real coding. We used flowcharts to define boolean expressions. And then at the end we made an app with conditional statements, onEvent coding and functions.
